# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project

This natural language processing project is an attempt to integrate the use of Mikolov's Word2Vec model along with a deep neural network. This implementaion attempts to classify the sentiment of movie reviews from Rotten Tomatoes. 

## Install

This project requires Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

- Keras   1.1.2 
- Scikit Learn   0.18 
- Numpy   1.11.1
- Pandas   0.18.1 
- Matplotlib   1.5.1
- Seaborn 0.7.1
- NLTK	3.2.4
- Gensim    3.0.0 

## Datasets

The dataset has been saved in this repository as train.tsv. It was acquired from a Kaggle competition(Link:https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews/data).

## Run

To run the iPython notebook, simply enter:

``` $ jupyter notebook Sentiment\ Analysis\ of\ Movie\ Reviews.ipynb ```
